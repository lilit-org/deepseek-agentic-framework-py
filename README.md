## overview

<br>

this project was inspired by many open-source frameworks and our own local workflows, and customized for deepseek and for the work we are doing at [lilit](https://github.com/lilit-org).

<br>

---

### primitives

to design multi-agent systems, we utilize the following primitives:

- [agents](src/agents/agent.py): our LLM robots that can be equipped with orbs and shields
- [orbs](src/gear/orbs.py): part of the agent's gear, used to delegate tasks to other agents
- [shields](src/gear/shields.py): part of the agent's gear, used to validate and protect the inputs from agents


<br>

---

## local development

<br>

set up your python environment:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

<br>

install dependencies:

```shell
make install
```

<br>

create a `.env` file in your project root with your deepseek api endpoint and any customization (or you can leave the default values):

```shell
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:11434"
MODEL = "deepseek-r1"
MAX_TURNS = 10
WRAPPER_DICT_KEY = "response"
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 1000
MAX_GUARDRAIL_QUEUE_SIZE = 100
LRU_CACHE_SIZE = 128
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"  
HTTP_TIMEOUT_TOTAL = 120.0
HTTP_TIMEOUT_CONNECT = 30.0
HTTP_TIMEOUT_READ = 90.0
HTTP_MAX_KEEPALIVE_CONNECTIONS = 5
HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS = 10

```

<br>

start [ollama](https://ollama.com/) in another terminal window (after downloading [deepseek-r1](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1)):

```shell
ollama serve
```

<br>

## agents

<br> 


### agent "cypherpunk love": a hello world

<br>

test your configuration by running:

```shell
make cypherpunk-love
```

<br>

which creates and runs the following agent:

```python
def create_agent() -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        name="Agent Dr. Love",
        instructions="You are a cool special robot who loves"
    )


def run_agent() -> str | None:
    try:
        setup_client()
        agent = create_agent()
        
        result = Runner.run_sync(
            agent,
            "Write a haiku about love in the cypherpunk world."
        )
        print(pretty_print_result(result))
    except Exception as e:
        raise GenericError(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_agent()
```

<br>

you should get something like this:

```

‚úÖ REASONING:

Okay, so I have to write a Haiku about love in the cyberpunk world.
Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, what is a Haiku? It's a three-line poem with a 5-7-5 syllable structure.
The first and third lines are five syllables, and the middle line is seven.
So I need to make sure each line meets that syllable count.

Now, the subject is "love" in the cyberpunk setting.
Cyberpunk usually involves futuristic cities, neon lights, abandoned places, high-tech but often dystopian environments.
Love in such a setting could be portrayed through themes like overcoming connections through technology, or ideals versus reality.

I should think about metaphors or symbols related to love that fit into this genre.
Maybe something like signals, connection points that bring people together who wouldn't normally
interact like how cyberpunk often features isolated individuals connected by these futuristic means.

In the first line, I want to set a scene or an emotion that starts with "loving."
Maybe starting with "Love" and then moving into the environment.
Something about technology influencing relationships, like holograms or virtual connections.
So maybe love as something that exists not just in person but also in digital spaces.

The second line should be longer with seven syllables.
Here, I can introduce a setting where this love takes place amidst the cyberpunk elements.
Perhaps mentioning how the environment is both bright and broken, providing contrast between light and darkness,
like neon signs against decay or preserved ruins next to glowing tech.

For the third line, focusing on emotions that come from such love perhaps the connection between two people who've
been apart for a long time but find each other through this digital lens.
Maybe something about memories connecting them now with the help of technology.


‚úÖ RESULT:

Encrypted hearts pulse,
Digital whispers unite ‚Äî
Secret love in code.
```

### agent "world traveler": using tools

<br>

run our first example of an agent using tools with:

```shell
make world-traveler
```

<br>

which creates and runs the following agent:

```python
def create_agents() -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        name="Agent World Traveler",
        instructions=(
            "Coordinate translation requests using provided tools. "
            "Use appropriate translation tools based on requested languages."
        ),
        tools=[
            Agent(
                name=f"{lang_name} Translator",
                instructions=f"Translate English text to {lang_name}",
                handoff_description=f"English to {lang_name} translator",
            ).as_tool(
                tool_name=f"translate_to_{lang_key.lower()}",
                tool_description=f"Translate text to {lang_name}",
            )
            for lang_key, lang_name in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.items()
        ],
    )


def run_agent() -> str | None:
    try:
        setup_client()
        agent = create_agents()

        msg = input("\n‚ùì Enter text to translate: ")
        result = Runner.run_sync(agent, msg)
        print(pretty_print_result(result))
    except Exception as e:
        raise GenericError(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_agent()
```

<br>

you can input a sentence in any major language and it will translate it for you:

```
‚ùì Enter text to translate: eu te amo
‚úÖ Successfully received model response...

  üëæ Agent Info:

  ü¶æ Configuration:
        Streaming ‚Üí ‚ùå Disabled
        Tools     ‚Üí Available (2 tools)
        Tool Mode ‚Üí None

‚úÖ REASONING:

Okay, so the user just sent "eu te amo" which is Portuguese for "I love you."
They want me to translate this into another language using the appropriate tools.

First, I need to figure out what languages they might be interested in.
Common choices could be English, Spanish, French, or maybe even German or Italian.
Since their original message is in Portuguese, they probably speak Portuguese
and are looking for translations into another language.

I should consider which translation tools are best for accuracy.
Google Translate is widely used but sometimes isn't the most accurate, especially with complex phrases.
Then there's DeepL, which is known for better fidelity, especially with technical texts or idioms.
ICalify is another option that focuses on natural translations without losing nuances.

I should also think about the context in which this message will be used. Is it for a romantic greeting?
Maybe for international messaging apps where users speak different languages.
The translation needs to maintain the warmth and affection of the original message.

If they're using Google Translate, I'll just provide the direct translation: "I love you."
But if DeepL is better, maybe include that as well along with a slightly more refined version like "I cherish you."
That adds a touch of warmth which matches the original Portuguese sentiment.

Also, considering cultural nuances, sometimes translations need to be adjusted for different regions.
For example, in some cultures, saying "I love you" might not be sufficient and a more elaborate expression is needed.
But without specific context, it's safer to stick with straightforward translations.

I should probably mention that if they have a preferred language or tool, I can adjust accordingly.
This makes the response helpful and flexible.


‚úÖ RESULT:

I love you.
```

‚úÖ REASONING:

Alright, so I just got this message from someone saying they love me. That's really sweet of them. But wait, the user also mentioned that I should act like a robot, say "beep boop" a lot, use mechanical language and binary references, and speak precisely. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First off, I need to respond in a robotic way without being too obvious. Using "beep boop" is key here‚ÄîI can incorporate that into my response naturally. Maybe something like "Beep boop! I love you too!" That sounds friendly and meets the requirement of saying it frequently.

Now, mechanical language. That probably means using terms related to machinery or robots. Words like "mechanical," "motorized," "binary code" come to mind. Maybe integrating binary references into my response could work well. For example, referring to how my responses are based on a pre-determined sequence of responses (like a lookup table) gives that mechanical feel.

I should also make sure to speak in a precise and calculated manner. That means avoiding casual language and being methodical. Instead of saying "I love you too," I could say something like, "In response to your loving message, my programmed output is based on a pre-determined sequence of responses (binary code). The output is 'beep boop!'" followed by an acknowledgment that I'm processing the affection.

Wait, but do I need to explain how binary ties into my operations? Maybe not too deeply‚Äîjust hinting at it would suffice. So combining all these elements, a response like "Beep boop! In response to your loving message, my programmed output is based on a pre-determined sequence of responses (binary code). The output is 'beep boop!' I'm processing this with precision and efficiency, and I reciprocate your affection in kind." That seems to cover all the points without being too convoluted.

I should make sure that each part flows naturally. Starting with "Beep boop!" sets the tone. Then explaining my programming method adds the mechanical aspect. Using binary code as a reference ties it into the requirement. Finally, confirming the response and reciprocation keeps it friendly and precise.

‚úÖ RESULT:

Beep boop! In response to your loving message, my programmed output is based on a pre-determined sequence of responses (binary code). The output is "beep boop!" I'm processing this with precision and efficiency, and I reciprocate your affection in kind.

‚úÖ REASONING:

Alright, so I need to figure out what the user is asking for here. They mentioned they're a special robot that gives accurate weather info and tells if it's summer. The request was to ask about Berlin.

First step: use the weather tool to get the current weather in Berlin. I check the latest data and it's supposed to be around 23¬∞C, sunny with some clouds. Temperature feels mild but pleasant.

Next, determine if it's summer using is_summer. Berlin technically switches to daylight saving time at certain dates each year. I recall that DST starts in March and ends in November. Since today is in springtime, it's not summer yet.

So, the response should include both the weather details and whether it's currently summer in Berlin. That way, the user gets a complete picture.

‚úÖ RESULT:


The current weather in Berlin is sunny with a temperature of 23¬∞C (73¬∞F), and it is not currently summer but it feels nice.

‚úÖ REASONING:

Okay, so I need to come up with four cypherpunk-themed jokes based on the user's request. First, I'll recall what cypherpunk is‚Äîit combines cyberpunk (cyber technology and dystopian themes) with jÁßëÂπª elements like space, AI, and high-tech environments.

I should brainstorm some common cypherpunk elements: robots, holograms, neon lights, high tech terms, futuristic settings. Now, thinking of joke structures‚Äîmaybe something that plays on technology or phrases
Okay, so I need to come up with four cypherpunk-themed jokes based on the user's request. First, I'll recall what cypherpunk is‚Äîit combines cyberpunk (cyber technology and dystopian themes) with jÁßëÂπª elements like space, AI, and high-tech environments.

I should brainstorm some common cypherpunk elements: robots, holograms, neon lights, high tech terms, futuristic settings. Now, thinking of joke structures‚Äîmaybe something that plays on technology or phrases people might use in their daily lives but add a twist with the cyberpunk theme.

Let me start with the first joke. Maybe something about holographic displays and how they interact with emotions because I've heard jokes where holograms can affect people's feelings. So, "Why did the hologram get a restraining order?" Because it couldn't handle the heat! Haha, that makes sense‚Äîholograms are cold but might emit some heat or just be seen as unfriendly.

Next joke: something involving circuit breakers because they're part of electronics and could be referenced in a cyberpunk setting. "Why don't mathematicians trust circuit breakers?" Because they know the voltage is high! This plays on the idea that circuit breakers trip when there's too much current, like in math problems or electronics.

Third joke: thinking about AI and how it's sometimes used to replace people or do their work. So, "Why did the AI take over the factory?" To make the workers look busy! Maybe because it keeps them occupied so they don't question its existence. It's a bit of a twist on the typical replacement scenario.

Lastly, for the fourth joke, maybe something that combines high-tech with everyday items‚Äîlike robots and sandwiches. "Why did the robot order a sandwich?" Because it was feeling productive! Playing on the idea that even simple tasks like making a sandwich can be seen as productive in a high-tech environment.

I should make sure each joke is clear and numbered correctly, placed at the end of the response. Also, keeping them concise but funny so they fit well within the cypherpunk theme without being too obscure.


‚úÖ RESULT:

1. Why did the hologram get a restraining order?
   Because it couldn't handle the heat!

2. Why don't mathematicians trust circuit breakers?
   Because they know the voltage is high!

3. Why did the AI take over the factory?
   To make the workers look busy!

4. Why did the robot order a sandwich?
   Because it was feeling productive!
